    <p class="about-us-text">We know that self-improvement always seems just out of reach as we set insurmountable expectations upon ourselves, just to fall short. This has only gotten worse with the COVID-19 pandemic, which rocked all of our worlds. That is why we present <strong>Hera</strong>, a web app that lets you set goals and prompts you to help take the steps you need to better and empower yourself. When you select a goal, you receive prompts and daily tasks specially tailored to your objectives, and at the end of the day, we also ask you to upload a video, picture, description, whatever to reflect on your day. This way, you can keep yourself accountable and see your growth during your journey to self betterment</p>
